			<div style="background-image:url(page.jpg)" class="text-page">In the midst of a lush, enchanted forest lived a young dragon named Draco. Unlike the large, fierce dragons often spoken of in tales, Draco was small, cheerful, and extremely playful. Today, Draco was soaring for the first time above the treetops, his tiny wings glittering under the morning sun. As he fluttered down, he noticed a group of animals gathered around something glimmering on the forest floor.</div>
			<div style="background-image:url(pages/dragon1.png)"></div>
			<div style="background-image:url(page.jpg)" class="text-page">Curious, Draco landed gently beside the animals which included a wise old owl, a pair of giggling squirrels, and a quietly nibbling rabbit. They were all staring at a pile of shiny, silvery berries. 'These are moonberries!' hooted the owl. 'Very rare and very delicious!' Draco's mouth watered at the sight, but he noticed there weren't enough berries to go around if he joined in.</div>
			<div style="background-image:url(pages/dragon2.png)"></div>
			<div style="background-image:url(page.jpg)" class="text-page">Feeling his stomach rumble, Draco felt a strong urge to swoop in and snatch the largest share for himself: he was a dragon, after all, and dragons loved treasures. However, as he stretched his claws toward the gleaming pile, he noticed the hopeful eyes of his new friends. Each animal looked on, clearly wishing for a taste of the special berries.</div>
			<div style="background-image:url(pages/dragon3.png)"></div>
			<div style="background-image:url(page.jpg)" class="text-page">With a thoughtful puff of smoke, Draco withdrew his claws. 'Why don't we share the moonberries?' he suggested. 'There might be just enough if we divide them.' The animals cheered at Draco's idea, and together, they carefully split the pile. Draco felt a warm glow in his chest as he watched everyone enjoy the tasty berries together.</div>
			<div style="background-image:url(pages/dragon4.png)"></div>
			<div style="background-image:url(page.jpg)" class="text-page">From that day on, Draco was more than just a dragon; he was a beloved friend to all in the forest. He learned that sharing not only brings joy to others but makes him feel happy too. Together, Draco and his friends had many more adventures, sharing not only treats but many wonderful moments.</div>
