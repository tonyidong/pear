			<div class="text-page">Once upon a time, in the colorful land of Candyville, there lived a tiny mouse named Mimi. Mimi was kind but very shy. Despite her size, Mimi dreamt of one day becoming a guardian of Candyville, just like her superhero, Captain Braveheart. But every time Mimi tried to speak up or stand tall, she would shrink back, worried that she was too small to be brave.</div>
			<div style="background-image:url(pages/1.webp)"></div>
			<div class="text-page">One day, while exploring the outskirts of Candyville, Mimi was startled by a sudden scream. She peeked through a bush and saw her friend, Benny the Bunny, caught in a net. Benny was the best hopscotch player in town, known for his giant leaps. Seeing him so scared made Mimi's heart race. 'Oh no, he needs help!' Mimi thought but hesitated, feeling the familiar wave of fear.</div>
			<div style="background-image:url(pages/2.webp)"></div>
			<div class="text-page">Just then, Mimi remembered her hero, Captain Braveheart, and how he always said, 'Bravery isn't about having no fear; it's about finding courage in spite of fear.' Mustered up all of her courage, Mimi took a deep breath and scrambled through the bushes towards Benny, despite the loud beating of her tiny mouse heart.</div>
			<div style="background-image:url(pages/3.webp)"></div>
			<div class="text-page">With quick thinking, Mimi started gnawing at the net. 'Hold on, Benny! I'll get you out,' she squeaked. Benny, feeling hopeful, cheered her on. After several tense minutes, the net finally gave way, and Benny was free! He hopped out and hugged Mimi tightly. 'Thank you, Mimi! You were so brave!' he exclaimed."</div>
			<div style="background-image:url(pages/4.webp)"></div>
			<div class="text-page">Word of Mimiâ€™s bravery spread across Candyville like wildfire. Even the Mayor of Candyville awarded her with a medal of courage. From that day on, Mimi never doubted her size or courage again. She knew that true bravery comes from within and that even the smallest creature can make a big difference. And so, Mimi continued to adventure, always ready to lend a helping hand, proving that anyone can be brave.</div>
